# Rag-based-Local-LLM-for-PDFs
The RAG-based Local LLM for PDFs project addresses the creation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model in conjunction with an LLM in order to efficiently process document automation. This system permits intelligent querying and summarization of the content in a PDF without external cloud-based models, ensuring local processing efficiency with data privacy in place. Important features include: Document Ingestion: Efficient extraction and indexing of the content from the large, complex PDF files. RAG Framework: Combines a retrieval mechanism (to fetch relevant text chunks) with generative capabilities (using an LLM) to provide contextual answers. Interactive chat interface: Where users can simply ask questions or request summaries; the responses can be generated automatically from the sections of the relevant PDF. This project is productive in enhancing productivity in document-intensive workflows and thus useful for enterprises handling confidential data.
